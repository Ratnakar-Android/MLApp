# MLApp

In the repo code, We have an android App which has android sdk integrated. Sdk is using Android ML 
tool kit for reading text from captured images and doing processing the Photo detection.

Prerequisites:

Branch name : master
Try to run the App on a real device to see the exact flow.

GutHub repo contains:

1. Image processing sdk based on ML kit.
2. Sample App.
3. Sdk flow document.


Fyi : For testing the feature we have stored image internally and reading text and detecting face from that, 
      if there is mutiface in a photo testing framework is giving error.
